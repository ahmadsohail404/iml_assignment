##### Program : Locally Weighted Regression Algorithm

##### Information : Locally Weighted Regression (LWR) is a non-parametric algorithm used for regression tasks. It fits separate regression models to small neighborhoods of data points, giving more weight to nearby points and less weight to distant points. LWR captures local patterns in the data, is robust to outliers, and doesn't assume any data distribution. However, it can be computationally expensive, requires parameter selection, and can overfit if not used carefully. LWR is used in finance, geostatistics, and computer vision
